- You may choose to do this project in either NextJS or CRA + ExpressJS.
- Your Backend can either be a simple JSON file or you may choose to run MongoDB with the following document structure:
```
[
  "id": string,

  "title": string,
  "issueNumber": number,
  "issueDate": string
]
```
- Your API must be capable of the full CRUD operations needed to manage the data items.
- Your application must be responsive.  Use the images in the /images folder as guide on how your page will look like in different devices.

Code Challenge For Frontend Dev

- You may choose to do this project using a framework of your choice (e.g. NextJS Vite + ExpressJS/NestJS, etc).
- Your Backend can either be a simple JSON file or you may choose to run MongoDB with the following document structure:
```
[
  "id": string,
  "imageUri": string,
  "title": string,
  "issueNumber": number,
  "issueDate": string
]
```
- Your API must be capable of the full CRUD operations needed to manage the data items, which, needless to say, should be implemented on the UI/client App.
- Your application must be responsive.  Use the images in the /images folder as guide on how your page will look like in different devices.
- Your application should be deployed in a live environment e.g. Heroku
- Feel free to add features to stand out. E.g. You may add searching / filtering and sorting, pagination/dynamic content loading, localization features
- Create a README file and explain why you choose certain libraries, technologies, methods or patterns.

Your work will be assessed through the following criteria:
- Code/folder organization
- Code cleanliness (naming, indentations, spacings, consistencies)
- Bonus points if you can demonstrate:
  - API unit testing (e.g. using mocha + chai)
  - Component unit-testing using (Jest or Vitest) + React-Testing Library
  - The use of React Context API and hooks
  - CSS Flexbox / CSS Grid
  - Typescript

When you are ready to submit, please send us your code repository and the live env url.
Please send your work or any enquiries to villamora@angloeastern.com / velardeb@angloeastern.com
